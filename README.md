# 12ftReader

A Flutter project for accessing the website 12ftLadder.
You can use android intents to share links e.g. to websites with paywalls with the 12ftReader app. The app will open a webview to 12ftLadder.com with the paywall removed.

## Getting Started
You can use Android Studio with Flutter setup to build the APK yourself.
